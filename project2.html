                    Assess, structure, manage and implement large data sets derived from real-time sources.  
                     Compile data from multiple sources, including data selection, data scrubbing and feature engineering, with an emphasis 
                    on tidy data and the tidyverse. 
                     Apply statistical tests and tools appropriately to analyze data sets drawn from different types of sources (nature, 
                    humankind, organizations, etc.), making inferences and projections from the data.  
                     Create visualizations of large data sets in ways that clarify understanding of their meaning and implications.  
                     Design and implement big data, artificial intelligence and statistical and visual analysis solutions that provide people and 
                    organizations with understanding, guidance and options drawn from the data.  
                     Demonstrate best practices regarding digital privacy and the ethical use of personal information.
